The Transformative Coaching Analysis Protocol (T-CAP) transforms coaching conversations into structured, actionable insights. Unlike traditional note-taking, T-CAP provides a comprehensive analytical framework that captures both surface-level interactions and deeper patterns, enabling coaches to deliver more impactful sessions while maintaining their focus on the client.

## Core Components

### 1. Coaching Essence Extraction (CEE)
At its heart, CEE distills the most vital elements of your coaching conversation.
