# Terms of Service
*Last update on 14th, August, 2024*

## Welcome
Welcome to CoachDash. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications, which include, but are not limited to, the CoachDash web app and extensions (the "Services"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at hello@CoachDash.com

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") are a binding contract between you and AIVISION PRODUCTS SRL ("CoachDash," "we" and "us"). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don't have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.

## Changes to Terms
We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the CoachDash website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.

If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## Privacy
When delivering the Service, CoachDash will collect and process personal data about you and your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree that CoachDash can use your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and in accordance with the consents you have given us.

CoachDash will comply with EU and US privacy regulations.

## Age Restrictions
CoachDash is only for people 16 years old and over. By using CoachDash, you affirm that you are over 16. If we learn that someone under 16 is using CoachDash, we'll terminate their account. For use in educational settings with students younger than 16 years old, contact us.

## Basic Usage Requirements
You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and username ("User ID"). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. For your User ID, you may not select a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to these Terms.

You will only use the Services in a professional way for business use and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If applicable laws prohibit your use of the Services, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for your use of the Services in a way that breaks the law. You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You are responsible for any activity associated with your account.
