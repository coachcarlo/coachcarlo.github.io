# Privacy Policy
*Last update on 14th August 2024*

## 1. Introduction
This policy describes what information we collect when you use CoachDash's site, services, products, and content ("Services"). It also provides information about how we store, transfer, use, and delete that information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

This policy applies to CoachDash's online meeting recording & transcription tool, including the website and web applications, and other CoachDash websites (collectively "the Websites"), as well as other interaction (e.g. customer support conversations, user surveys and interviews etc.) you may have with CoachDash.

This policy applies where we are acting as a Data Controller with respect to the personal data of users of our Services; in other words, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data. For content and data that you upload to or make available through the Service ("User Content"), you are responsible for ensuring this content is in accordance with our Terms of Service, and that the content is not violating other users' privacy.

## 2. Data Collection
We at CoachDash are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. Our business model is to provide a paid service to users who need to record, index, analyze, share and store meeting recordings, and does not rely on widespread collection of general user data. We will only collect and process information that we need to deliver the service to you, and to continue to maintain and develop the service.

CoachDash does not access your recordings and transcripts at any point, unless you personally share access with individual employees for technical support. Also in those cases only recordings and transcripts with access rights given to the support team member will be accessed.

CoachDash may collect, store and process various kinds of data, with different legal grounds, as listed below. We will not sell collected data to other companies.

### User Account Information
Users that choose to register in CoachDash are asked to sign up with an external authentication service, e.g. Google Sign-In or similar. We will fetch and store email address, name and profile image URL from this service.

We will never access the content in conversations, unless upon specific request by the user who recorded this content with our Services.

### Video Recordings
We alert participants when they join meetings if you are recording a meeting with our service. Participants have the option to leave the meeting. As you are using CoachDash to record meetings, you are responsible for collecting consents from all participants in the meeting prior to starting the recording. The transcript, which may also contain personal data, is treated the same way as the video recording. Video recordings and transcripts will not be accessed by CoachDash, unless upon specific request by the user who created such recordings with CoachDash.
